The main goal of this project is to classify breast ultrasound images as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on their visual features.
Although the dataset is relatively simple and contains only 250 images, it serves as a good example to show my understanding of data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and building classification models.

In this project, I:

Loaded breast ultrasound images from benign and malignant folders

Converted them to grayscale and resized them to 28×28 pixels

Normalized and flattened the image arrays

Split the dataset into training and testing sets

Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance and create a balanced training set

Trained and tested three machine learning algorithms: SVM, Random Forest, and KNN

This was a practice dataset, so the models achieved very high accuracy (close to 100%). The main purpose of this project was to practice the full workflow — from image preprocessing to model evaluation — using a clear and manageable dataset.
