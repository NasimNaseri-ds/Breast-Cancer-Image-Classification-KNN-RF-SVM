Breast Ultrasound Image Classification Project
This project uses a simple dataset of breast ultrasound images to demonstrate my ability to handle most stages of a data science workflow.
The dataset may be straightforward, but proper data preprocessing was applied as a necessary step.Additionally, I addressed data imbalance using SMOTE and implemented multiple classification algorithms including KNN, Random Forest, and SVM.
The goal is to showcase my understanding and practical skills across various levels of the data pipeline on a clear example.
